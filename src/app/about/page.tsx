 As a designer turned developer, I found my calling in blending artistic flair with technical skill. My journey has led me to specialize in front-end development, where I craft interactive experiences that are not just functional, but also visually stunning. 
 
 When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with digital art or exploring the latest in web animation.`;
